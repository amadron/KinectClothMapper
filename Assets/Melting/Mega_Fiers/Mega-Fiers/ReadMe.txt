Overview
****************************************
For more complete and up to date docs as well as tutorial videos please visit the web site at http://www.west-racing.com/mf

A system of mesh modifiers for Unity written in C# and provided as a dll Assembly for Unity. The modifiers included can be applied individually or multiple mods can be added to a mesh based object in Unity. The system is inspired by the 3ds max system so users of max should find most of the functionality and params familiar, and for others there is no coding required just setting of params to alter effects. Please note this is currently in beta so there could well be some issues that need sorting out. There may be a slight mismatch on Axis on some modifiers, the system was converted over from code for our own engine where Z was up.

I have other modifiers almost ready to be added and I will add these very shortly, they include FFD Cyl, FFD Box, Path deform and also a system of World Space modifiers such as ripple and wave. These will be added as updates to the system in the next few weeks. I may also add our code for exporting modifiers from Max if there is a need for it. It would be possible for the user to add their own Modifiers to the system and I will probably expose that shortly as well. And if anyone has anything they need then please feel free to email me at chris@west-racing.com.

All code is copyright Chris West 2012 and any use outside of the Unity engine is not permitted.

****************************************
How to use:
****************************************
To add a modifier to a mesh you first need to add the ModifyObject.cs component to the object then add the Modifiers you require. The ModifyObject.cs script is the manager for any modifiers on the object, it allows multiple modifiers to be stacked on top of one another to achieve different end results. Once the manager is in place drag and drop the modifier you want to the object. Each modifier is represented by a yellow box and the effect of the modifier is shown by this box so you can judge what will happen at runtime. If a modifier can be constrained to an area red and green boxes will show the extents of the constraint.

Each modifiers space is controlled by the gizmo pos, rot and scale params, usually you can leave these at default values of 0, but in case an effect doesnt quite happen in the way you could play with these values to get the desired result.

If you arnt planning on having any modifications happen in game and are just deforming meshes then you can delete all the modifier scripts once you are happy with a deformation and just be left with a deformed mesh.

****************************************
Modifier
****************************************
All the modifiers share some common params.
Class:
public class Modifier : MonoBehaviour
{
	public bool			ModEnabled;
	public bool			DisplayGizmo;
	public int			Order;
	public Vector3		Offset;
	public Vector3		gizmoPos;
	public Vector3		gizmoRot;
	public Vector3		gizmoScale;
}

Mod Enabled		-	Turns the modifier on/off
Display Gizmo	-	Shows the box gizmo for the modifier, usually you will have this on but if you have multiple							modifiers on a mesh it can get confusing.
Order			-	When more than modifier is in the stack the order they are processed in can be important, so a							modifier with Order value of -1 will be processed before one of Order 0
Offset			-	Offset added to each vertex before the modifier is applied, the effect of this depends on the modifier.
Gizmo Pos		-	A local offset added to the vertex, again its effect varies on the modifier in use.
Gizmo Rot		-	A local rotation of the modifier space.
Gizmo Scale		-	A local scale of the modifier space.

****************************************
ModifyObject
****************************************
ModifyObject is derived from Modifiers.

Class:
public class Modifiers : MonoBehaviour
{
	public bool			recalcnorms;
	public bool			recalcbounds;
	public bool			Enabled;
	public bool			DoLateUpdate;
	public bool			GrabVerts;
}

public class ModifyObject : Modifiers
{
}

Param description:
Enabled			-	When enabled the modifier stack is evaluated to get the final vertex positions, if not enabled the						last calculated positions will be used, so generally you will clear this when you have calculated a						desired	effect on a mesh to stop further calculations being done, and you will enable again if							further modifications need to be made.
RecalcNorms		-	Tell the system to recalculate normals for the mesh after the stack has been evaluated.
RecalcBounds	-	Tell the system to recalulate the bounds info for the mesh.
DoLateUpdate	-	Set if you require the modifier stack to be evaluated and applied in the LateUpdate instead of							Update
GrabVerts		-	Grabs the mesh verts again at start of modify. Use if something higher up the pipeline alters the						mesh vertices.

Modifiers:

****************************************
Bend:
****************************************
The Bend modifier lets you bend the current selection about a single axis, producing a uniform bend in an object's geometry. You can control the angle and direction of the bend on any of three axes. You can also limit the bend to a section of the geometry.

Class:
public class Bend : Modifier
{
	public float		angle;
	public float		dir;

To				- Upper boundary of the effect

****************************************
Bubble:
****************************************
The Bubble modifier will inflate or pinch an object according to the transformation of the modifier's gizmo, the radius and falloff parameters.

Class:
public class Bubble : Modifier
{
	public float		radius;
	public float		falloff;
}

Param description:
Radius			-	Is the length of the offset a vertex would get if it's distance from the gizmo evaluates as zero. This						parameter can be set to a negative value as well to create a pinch effect.
Falloff			-	Determines how far from the gizmo will the bubble effect the deformation.

****************************************
Hump:
****************************************
Hump is a simpleMod scripted plug-in modifier which folding an object according to the transformation of the modifier's gizmo, the amount and heaping parameters over X, Y or Z axis.

Class:
public class Hump : Modifier
{
	public float		amount;
	public float		cycles;
	public float		phase;
	public bool			animate;
	public float		speed;
	public Axis			axis;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	Amount of hump
Cycles			-	Number of humps to apply
Phase			-	Shifts the wave
Animate			-	Animate the effect
Speed			-	Speed of animation
Axis			-	Axis to apply effect to

****************************************
Melt:
****************************************
The Melt modifier lets you apply a realistic melting effect to the mesh. Options include sagging of edges, spreading while melting, and a customizable set of substances ranging from a firm plastic surface to a jelly type that collapses in on itself.

Class:
public class Melt : Modifier
{
	public float		Amount;
	public float		Spread;
	public MeltMat		MaterialType;
	public float		Solidity;
	public Axis			axis;
	public bool			FlipAxis;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	Specifies the extent of the "decay," or melting effect applied to the gizmo, thus affecting the object.
Spread			-	Specifies how much the object and melt will spread as the Amount value increases. It's basically a "bulge"					along a	flat plane.
Material Type	- 	Ice. The default Solidity setting.
					Glass. Uses a high Solidity setting to simulate glass.
					Jelly. Causes a significant drooping effect in the center.
					Plastic. Relatively solid, but droops slightly in the center as it melts.
					Custom. User set value.

Solidity		-	If material is Custom sets how solid the mesh is.
Axis			-	Choose the axis on which the melt will occur.

Flip Axis		-	Normally, the melt occurs from the positive direction toward the negative along a given axis. Turn on Flip					Axis to	reverse this direction.

****************************************
Noise:
****************************************
The Noise modifier modulates the position of an object's vertices along any combination of three axes. This modifier simulates random variations in an object's shape. Using a fractal setting, you can achieve random, rippling patterns, like a flag in the wind. The results of the Noise modifier are most noticeable on objects that have greater numbers of faces.

Class:
public class Noise : Modifier
{
	public int			Seed;
	public float		Scale;
	public bool			Fractal;
	public float		Freq;
	public float		Iterations;
	public bool			Animate;
	public float		Phase;
	public float		Rough;
	public Vector3		Strength;
}

Param description:
Seed			-	Generates a random start point from the number you set.
Scale			-	Sets the size of the noise effect (not strength). Larger values produce smoother noise, lower values more					jagged noise
Strength		-	Set the strength of the noise effect along each of three axes. Enter a value for at least one of these						axes to produce a noise effect.
Animate			-	Regulates the combined effect of Noise and Strength parameters. The following parameters adjust the							underlying wave.
Freq			-	Sets the periodicity of the sine wave. Regulates the speed of the noise effect. Higher frequencies make						the noise quiver faster. Lower frequencies produce a smoother and more gentle noise.
Phase			-	Shifts the start and end points of the underlying wave.
Fractal			-	Produces a fractal effect based on current settings.

If you turn on Fractal, the following options are available: 
Rough			-	Determines the extent of fractal variation. Lower values are less rough than higher values.
Iterations		-	Controls the number of iterations (or octaves) used by the fractal function. Fewer iterations use less						fractal	energy and generate a smoother effect. An iteration of 1.0 is the same as turning Fractal off.

****************************************
Push:
****************************************
The Push modifier lets you "push" object vertices outward or inward along the average vertex normals. This produces an "inflation" effect.

Class:
public class Push : Modifier
{
	public float		amount;
	public NormType		method;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	How far to push vertices.
Method			-	Leave as normals for now, other values are being tested.

****************************************
RadialSkew:
****************************************
Radial Skew skews objects radially instead of along a single axis.

Class:
public class RadialSkew : Modifier
{
	public float		angle;
	public Axis			axis;
	public Axis			eaxis;
	public bool			biaxial;
}

Param description:
Angle			-	Angle of the Skew
Axis			-	Major axis of the skew
EAxis			-	Effective axis of the skew
BiAxial			-	This is similar to what Taper produces when both its primary and effect axes are set to single axes, but					here, the points are moved depending on which side of the center axis they lie along the effect axis. And,					again, the adjustment is described with an angular measurement, not a percentage.

****************************************
Ripple:
****************************************
The Ripple modifier lets you produce a concentric rippling effect in an object's geometry. You can set either of two ripples or a combination of both.

Class:
public class Ripple : Modifier
{
	public float		amp;
	public float		amp2;
	public float		flex;
	public float		wave;
	public float		phase;
	public float		Decay;
	public bool			animate;
}

Param description:
Amp/ Amp 2		-	Amplitude 1 produces a ripple across the object in one direction, while Amplitude 2 creates a similar						ripple at right angles to the first (that is, rotated 90 degrees about the vertical axis).
Wave			-	Specifies the distance between the peaks of the wave. The greater the length, the smoother and more							shallow the ripple for a given amplitude.
Phase			-	Shifts the ripple pattern over the object. Positive numbers move the pattern inward, while negative							numbers move it outward. This effect becomes especially clear when animated.
Decay			-	Limits the effect of the wave generated from its center. The value of 0.0 means that the wave will							generate infinitely from its center. Increasing the Decay value causes the wave amplitudes to decrease						with distance from the center, thus limiting the distance over which the waves are generated.
Animate			-	Animate the ripple
Radius			-	Radius of the gizmo
Segments		-	Number of segments in the gizmo
Circles			-	Number of circles in the gizmo

****************************************
Skew:
****************************************
The Skew modifier lets you produce a uniform offset in an object's geometry. You can control the amount and direction of the skew on any of three axes. You can also limit the skew to a section of the geometry.

Class:
public class Skew : Modifier
{
	public float		amount;
	public bool			doRegion;
	public float		to;
	public float		from;
	public float		dir;
	public Axis			axis;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	Sets the angle to skew from the vertical plane.
Direction		-	Sets the direction of the skew relative to the horizontal plane.
Axis			-	Specify the axis that will be skewed.
Do Region		-	Constrain modifier to a region
From			-	Start of region
To				-	End of region

****************************************
Spherify:
****************************************
The Spherify modifier distorts an object into a spherical shape. This modifier has only one parameter: a Percent spinner that deforms the object, as much as possible, into a spherical shape. The success of the operation depends on the topology of the geometry to which it's applied. For example, a cylinder with no height segments will result in little change. Adding height segments will result in a barrel at 100 percent. Adding cap segments will produce a sphere.

Class:
public class Spherify : Modifier
{
	public float		percent;
}

Param description:
Percent			-	Sets the percentage of spherical distortion to apply to an object.

****************************************
Stretch:
****************************************
The Stretch modifier simulates the traditional animation effect of "squash-and-stretch." Stretch applies a scale effect along a specified stretch axis and an opposite scale along the two remaining minor axes. The amount of opposite scaling on the minor axes varies, based on distance from the center of the scale effect. The maximum amount of scaling occurs at the center and falls off toward the ends.

Class:
public class Stretch : Modifier
{
	public float		amount;
	public bool			doRegion;
	public float		to;
	public float		from;
	public float		amplify;
	public Axis			axis;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	Sets the base scale factor for all three axes. The scale factor derived from the Stretch value varies						according to the sign of the value.

						Positive stretch values define a scale factor equal to Stretch+1. For example, a stretch value of 1.5						yields a scale factor of 1.5+1=2.5, or 250 percent.
					
						Negative stretch values define a scale factor equal to -1/(Stretch-1). For example, a stretch value of						-1.5 yields a scale factor of -1/(-1.5-1)=0.4, or 40 percent.
					
					The calculated scale factor is applied to the selected stretch axis and the inverse scale is applied to						the minor axes.

Amplify			-	Changes the scale factor applied to the minor axes. Amplify generates a multiplier using the same							technique as stretch. The multiplier is then applied to the Stretch value before the scale factor for the					minor axes is calculated.	Amplify values affect scaling along the minor axes in the following way:
						A value of 0 has no effect. It uses the default scale factor calculated from the Stretch amount.
						Positive values exaggerate the effect.
						Negative values reduce the effect.
Axis			-	Axis to stretch along
Do Region		-	Constrain the effect to a region
From			-	Start of the region
To				-	End of the region

****************************************
Taper:
****************************************
The Taper modifier produces a tapered contour by scaling both ends of an object's geometry; one end is scaled up, and the other is scaled down. You can control the amount and curve of the taper on two sets of axes. You can also limit the taper to a section of the geometry.

Class:
public class Taper : Modifier
{
	public float		amount;
	public bool			doRegion;
	public float		to;
	public float		from;
	public float		dir;
	public Axis			axis;
	public EffectAxis	EAxis;
	public float		crv;
	public bool			sym;
}

Param description:
Amount			-	The extent to which the ends are scaled.
Crv				-	Applies a curvature to the sides of the Taper gizmo, thus affecting the shape of the tapered object.						Positive values produce an outward curve along the tapered sides, negative values an inward curve. At 0,					the sides are unchanged.
Dir				-	Swivel amount around axis.
Axis			-	The central axis or spine of the taper: X, Y, or Z.
EAxis			-	The axis, or pair of axes, indicating the direction of the taper from the primary axis. The available						choices are determined by the choice of primary axis.
Sym				-	Produces a symmetrical taper around the primary axis. A taper is always symmetrical around the effect axis
Do Region		-	Limit effect to a region.
From			-	Start of region.
To				-	End of region.

****************************************
Twist:
****************************************
The Twist modifier produces a twirling effect (like wringing out a wet rag) in an object's geometry. You can control the angle of the twist on any of three axes, and set a bias that compresses the twist effect relative to the pivot point. You can also limit the twist to a section of the geometry.

Class:
public class Twist : Modifier
{
	public float		angle;
	public bool			doRegion;
	public float		from;
	public float		to;
	public float		Bias;
	public Axis			axis;
}

Param description:
Angle			-	Determines the amount of twist around the vertical axis.
Bias			-	Causes the twist rotation to bunch up at either end of the object. When the parameter is negative, the					object twists closer to the gizmo center. When the value is positive, the object twists more away from					the gizmo center. When the parameter is 0, the twisting is uniform.
Axis			-	Specify the axis along which the twist will occur. This is the local axis of the Twist gizmo.
Do Region		-	Limit effect to a region of the mesh
From			-	Start of the region
To				-	End of the region.

****************************************
Wave:
****************************************
The Wave modifier produces a wave effect in an object's geometry. You can use either of two waves, or combine them. Wave uses a standard gizmo and center, which you can transform to increase the possible wave effects.

Class:
public class Wave : Modifier
{
	public float		amp;
	public float		amp2;
	public float		flex;
	public float		wave;
	public float		phase;
	public float		Decay;
	public float		dir;
	public bool			animate;
}

Param description:
Amp/Amp 2		-	Amplitude 1 produces a sine wave along the gizmo's Y axis, while Amplitude 2 creates a wave along the X					axis (although peaks and troughs appear in the same direction with both). Switching a value from						positive to negative reverses the positions of peaks and troughs.
Wave			-	Specifies the distance in current units between the crests of both waves.
Phase			-	Shifts the wave pattern over the object. Positive numbers move the pattern in one direction, while						negative numbers move it in the other. This effect is especially clear when animated.
Decay			-	Limits the effect of the wave generated from its origin. A decay value decreases the amplitude at						increasing distance from the center. As this value increases, the wave is concentrated at the center					and flattened until it disappears (completely decays).
Dir				-	Direction of wave
Animate			-	Animate the wave
Divs			-	Number of divisions in the gizmo
NumSegs			-	Number of segements in the gizmo
NumSides		-	Number of sides in the gizmo

****************************************
FFD
****************************************
FFD stands for Free-Form Deformation. The FFD modifier surrounds the selected geometry with a lattice. By adjusting the control points of the lattice, you deform the enclosed geometry.

There are three FFD modifiers, each providing a different lattice resolution: 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4. The 3x3 modifier, for example, provides a lattice with three control points across each of its dimensions or nine on each side of the lattice.

KnotSize		-	Relationship of knotsize to lattice grid size
inVol			-	Only deform points that lie inside the source volume.
pt				-	Array of 64 vector3 which hold the control points, for 2x2x2 first 8 are used, 3x3x3 first 27

****************************************
Displace
****************************************

}

Param Description:
Amount			-	Amount of bulge on each axis.
FallOff			-	Falloff of the bulge on each axis.
LinkFallOff		-	Link all falloff values to the x axis value

****************************************
Cylindrify

Class:
public class Cylindrify : Modifier
{
	public float Percent = 0.0f;
	public float Decay = 0.0f;
}

Param Description:
Percent			-	Amount of transform towards a Cylinder

****************************************
Start of a page turning system. This one is very much wip in progress, it works but there is room for improvement, I hope
to add a page mesh generator and also a proper book system. Iam not going to document this yet as it really is WIP.


****************************************
UV Adjust

****************************************
WarpBind
****************************************
This modifier needs to be added to any object that you want to bind/connect to a world space warp ie ripple. You would first add a RippleWarp to an empty gamobject in the scene and set the desired params for that, then on the mesh object you want to be modified by that world space warp you would add ModifyObject as per normal and then add the WarpBind modifier selecting for the SourceWarpObj the game object with the ripple effect. The mesh will now deform based on the positions of the warp and the object. Both the world warp and the warpbind mod have decay values that work together to limit the range of the effect. The warp decay value will effect all objects bound to it whereas the WarpBind decay will only effect the object it is attached to.

Class:
public class WarpBind : Modifier
{
	public GameObject	SourceWarpObj;
	public float		decay;
}

Param Description:
SourceWarpObj	-	Space warp scene object to use for the deformation
decay			-	Limit the range of the deformation for this object

****************************************
Warp
****************************************
This is the base class for Space Warps, so most of these params will work across all space warps. Exceptions being ripple where it ignores the size and uses a radius value.

Class:
public class Warp : MonoBehaviour
{
	public float	Width;
	public float	Height;
	public float	Length;
	public float	Decay;
	public bool		Enabled;
	public bool		DisplayGizmo;
}

Param Description:
Width		-	Width of the warp
Height		-	Height of the warp
Length		-	Length(depth) of the warp
Decya		-	Decay value for the effect, this will effect all objects bound to the warp
Enabled		-	Is warp on
DisplaGizmo	-	Enable display of the gizmo in the editor

****************************************
Warps
****************************************
All the warps below behave and have the same params as their mesh based versions, so please refer to those of help;

The warps so far include are:
	Bend Warp
	Noise Warp
	Ripple Warp
	Skew Warp
	Stretch Warp
	Taper Warp
	Twist Warp
	Wave Warp

****************************************
PivotAdjust
****************************************
You can use this simple modifier to alter the pivot position of a mesh and or change its orientation. Use the normal Offset and gizmo params to adjust the pivot.

****************************************
Morph
****************************************
Use the morph modifier to change the shape of the mesh towards given target meshes. You can have multiple morphing channels and each channel can have multiple target meshes to generate super smooth morphs.

Moprh support has been added back in. I have changed the whole system from my first morph system and it now works via .obj files so making it compatible with any 3d software that exports to the .obj format.

To prepare your meshes for use by the morpher you should first align all the targets and the base mesh to 0,0,0 in the editor software. You should then select the base undeformed mesh and export just that to a .obj file calling it something like BaseMapping.obj. The morph system will use this to match the unity vertex information to the morph vertex data. This is required as unity will very often add new vertices to a mesh when it imports it. Next you will need to export your targets. The morph system allows for any number of morph channels and each channel can have any number of targets making up the morph, so you could export each individual target as a seperate obj file, but a better way is to select all the meshes that make a morph and export to a single obj file. When you load the targets you will be able to change the order and add or delete targets if you need.

When you apply the Morph modifier to an object you will see a red button called 'Load Mapping' you need to click this and load the base mapping obj file. If the import went ok the button will go green to show you have valid mapping imformation. If the import fails it is probably because you didnt centre everything on 0,0,0 before exporting or the scales are wrong. Unity will apply a scaling to a mesh on import and you need to make sure the obj export is set to the same scale. If you think it is a scale issue there is a importScale value in the Morph interface you can adjust and try again.

Once you have the mapping in you will need to add a channel. You do this by clicking the Add Channel button. A new set of params will show up in the inspector. Click the Load Targets button and select the target obj file. The modifier will load all meshes in that file as targets and assign weights based on the order of meshes in the obj file. It may be that the order is not correct, if so use the Up/Dn buttons to reorganise the target list. You can also delete a target if you need to. If you select Load Targets again it will update any targets that are already imported and add any new ones it finds. You can also change the percentage at when each target is used to adust the animation. Also the morph uses a bezier interpolation system to give a much smoother animation result but sometimes this isnt desired, if so set the tension value to 0 to make it linear, a value of 0.5 usually gives a nice smooth result.

Each channel has a button to open and close the params just to tidy up the interface a little, the channel percentage slider will stay visible though so you can easily play with settings.

The morph system is still a work in progress so please report any issues or any new features you would like to see. The system uses mesh data from the 3d software as opposed to the unity mesh data for its processing, this gives a much more efficent system, for example the wood pipe example in the included scene has over a 1000 vertices one unity has imported it but only 666 vertices in the morph system. I will be adding further optimizations to this to remove any unmorphed verts in a channel which will really help memory and performance, not that its slow at the moment :)

Path Deform
****************************************
The PathDeform modifier deforms an object using a spline as a path. You can move and stretch the object along the path, and rotate and twist it about the path. The usual gizmo and offset values can also be used to alter the look of the deformation.

Class:
public class PathDeform : Modifier
{
	public float		percent;
	public float		stretch;
	public float		twist;
	public float		rotate;
	public Axis			axis;
	public bool			flip;
	public MegaShape	path;
	public bool			animate;
	public float		speed;
	public bool			drawpath;
	public float		tangent;
}

Param Description:
percent		-	Moves the object along the path based on a percentage of the path length.
stretch		-	Scales the object along the path, using the object's pivot point as the base of the scale.
twist		-	Twists the object about the path. The twist angle is based on the rotation of one end of the overall					length of the path. Typically, the deformed object takes up only a portion of the path, so the effect can				be subtle.
rotate		-	Rotates the object about the path.
axis		-	Changes the alignment of the path to local axis of the object
flip		-	Reverses the direction
path		-	Path to deform along, must be a MegaShape object in the scene
animate		-	Automatically move the object along the path.
speed		-	Speed to move the object
drawpath	-	Display the deformation path
tangent		-	How far to look ahead to get the direction of the path

****************************************
MegaShape
****************************************
MegaShape is a spline object from another system Iam working on. It allows the user to build shapes using knots and control the shape with handles on each knot. To use create an empty object in the scene and add the MegaShape script to it and then click add knot. Each knot can be positioned and its handles altered to get the desired shape. There is an option to close the shape as well. I am still working on the making the MegaShape easier to use and will be adding features to it in further releases.

****************************************
Enumerations:
****************************************
public enum MegaAxis
{
	X = 0,
	Y = 1,
	Z = 2,
};

public enum MegaEffectAxis
{
	X = 0,
	Y = 1,
